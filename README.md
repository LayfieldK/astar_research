# astar_research
This is my senior research project from 2009.  It is an application that allows a user to run pathfinding simulations on a variety of agents.
The idea of the project was to compare the total time required for varying numbers of agents to reach their destinations using two different variations of A* pathfinding - traditional (or local) and HCA.
